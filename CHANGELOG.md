Each release is a `vX.Y.Z` tag; `release.yml` runs the fast and slow test tiers and publishes the tag's section below as the GitHub release notes. Add changes under `## Unreleased`; a release renames it.

## v0.1.0

- feat: playable Sudoku MVP — seeded generator with exactly one solution per puzzle (singles-solvable, medium clue count scaled by board size), box size 2–5 via a size picker (4×4, 9×9, 16×16 with letters, 25×25 generated in a Web Worker), selection with row/column/box and same-digit highlighting, conflict marking with `aria-invalid`, number pad with remaining counts, undo/redo/erase/restart, pause, timer that stops on a hidden tab, completion dialog, and the game saved in localStorage across reloads
- chore: tooling from driftline — vitest fast/slow tiers, playwright browser test in CI, GitHub Pages deploy with PR previews and `<meta name="commit">`, release on `v*` tags, nightly slow run, secret scan, `do-not-merge` check, `.maintainer.yaml` auto-release
